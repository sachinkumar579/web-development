Within a cluster 
Master node - a VM like AWS EC2 - API server and scheduler must be installed 
Worker node - Docker and kubelets should be installed 

kubectl or kube control tool - tool for sending instructions to cluster - install in the local machine 

Minikube - tool uses vm in ur local machine to create clusters - can be used to playaround with kubernetes 
minikube is local Kubernetes, focusing on making it easy to learn and develop for Kubernetes.
creates a single node cluster 


Installation steps 

1) Install chocolatey windows package manager https://chocolatey.org/

Run command in powershell in admin mode
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

2) Reopen powershell in admin mode and run command https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/#install-kubectl-binary-with-curl-on-windows
command choco install kubernetes-cli

kubectl will be installed 

3) from cmd run cd %USERPROFILE%
mkdir .kube
cd .kube
create a file called .config 

4) Install minikube using chocolatey https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
choco install minikube

5) Launch docker desktop 
hyperv driver didnt work because hyperv role cannot be installed on Windows 10 Home 
open cmd in admin mode and run command 
minikube start --driver=docker
This virtual cluster in a virtual machine is created with the help of docker instead of other drivers  

This will create a virtual machine with a development cluster containing a single master and worker node which share resources.
This will install other softwares like API server, kubelet ...

6) Status 
minikube status
minkube delete - deletes the virtual machine created  

7) visual dashboard 
minikube dashboard 

Turns out docker eats up a lot of RAM and virtual box didnt work

* Suggestion: Virtualization support is disabled on your computer. If you are running minikube within a VM, try '--driver=docker'. Otherwise, consult your systems BIOS manual for how to enable virtualization.
