              <b>git checkout -b newbranch </b>- The above example
              simultaneously creates and checks out new-branch. The -b option is
              a convenience flag that tells Git to run git branch before running

                switch to a remote branch. make sure to fetch remote branch with

                versions of Git, you can then checkout the remote branch like a
                local branch.

            Tagging is generally used to capture a point in history that is used
            for a marked version release (i.e. v1. 0.1). A tag is like a branch
            that doesn't change. Unlike branches, tags, after being created,
            have no further history of commits</span
